Dear Tongyi Dou,

You have registered douty@dlut.edu.cn at the I-TASSER server http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER. Your password is 
IT_81e85
 (please remember not to include space when you type the password which is the mistake that has been made most frequently by new users). You can use this password to submit your jobs as well as search/delete your submitted sequence(s) on the I-TASSER server. Thanks for the registration and have a happy prediction!

Please note that this registration is only for the on-line I-TASSER server but NOT for the I-TASSER Suite package or I-TASSER Forum (you need to register them separately if you want to use them since they are different systems from the I-TASSER server).

If you did not register this email on our website, please neglect this email and we apologize for the mistake.
