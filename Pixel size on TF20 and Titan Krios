Hi all,
 
Jiansen calibrated the pixel size of the K2 cameras on Krios and F20 at the most frequently used magnifications. Here are the numbers:
 
Titan Krios:
165 kx: 0.83 A/pixel (calibrated using gold single crystals)
130 kx: 1.06 A/pixel (calibrated using gold single crystals)
 
TF20:
50 kx: 0.74 A/pixel (fitted using single particle reconstruction)
29 kx: 1.26 A/pixel (fitted using single particle reconstruction)
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 
Best,
Huaibin
