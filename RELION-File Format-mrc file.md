MRC is a file format that has become industry standard in cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and electron tomography (ET), where the result of the technique is a three-dimensional grid of voxels each with a value corresponding to electron density or electric potential. It was developed by the MRC (Medical Research Council, UK) Laboratory of Molecular Biology.[1] In 2014, the format was standardised.[2] The format specification is available on the CCP-EM website.

The MRC format is supported by many of the software packages listed in b:Software Tools For Molecular Microscopy.
