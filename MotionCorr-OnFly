Hi Bertram,
 
I have updated my scripts and installed them for all users on micefdata1. Could you please put the attached shell script to a folder that is in the default search path of all users, such as '/usr/local/bin', and make it executable.
 
Huaibin, after that script is installed, users just need to run "unattended_motioncor2.sh" to start the motioncor2 script. Ask users not to run the old copy of scripts that they installed in their folders as those are already obsolete. Also ask users not to use their previous config.txt files as some options have been changed.
 
This is new and simplified protocol:
1. login to micefdata1.niddk.nih.gov
2. go to the data folder (before copying data to the folder)
3. if there is an existing "config.txt" file, backup it and then delete it (do it on micefdata1 on K2 computer)
4. run "unattended_motioncor2.sh"; a new "config.txt" file will be created automatically
5. edit "config.txt" file by uncommenting the appropriate section near the end of file (do it on micefdata1 on K2 computer) 
6. start to transfer K2 movie files to the folder
7. terminate the script when image acquisition is done

Best regards,
Jiansen
