# Step04 - Particle Picking using GAutomatch ?

- [ ] cd to the MotionCor results folder generated by RELION (if you do MotionCor using RELION) -> cd to folder 2020... where you can find the *.mrc file

then,

[user@biowulf]$ sinteractive --gres=gpu:k80:1 --mem=20g -c14
[user@biowulf]$ module load gautomatch
[user@cn3144 ~]$ gautomatch --apixM 0.83 --diameter 160 *.mrc

# Step06 - Import particle files generated by GAutomatch 

Input files: box_Gautomatch/box/*.box
Node type: 2D/3D particle coordinates (*.box, *_pick.star)

# Step07 - Subset selection 

Select ~200 images to make a subset, then extract particles from these images and do a quick Class2D. After quick Class2D, we can get templates that may used for template-based Autopick. In this way, we can get more accurate particle picking, and thus lower down the requirement for computational capability of following work, e.g. Class2D, Class 3D, which always cost several days for iterations and calcutations.

Number of classes: 1

Regularisation parameter T: 4

Number of iterations: 20

Use fast subsets (for large datasets)? Yes

Mask diameter (A): 200

Mask individual particles with zeros? Yes

*If set to Yes, then in the individual particles, the area outside a circle with the radius of the particle will be set to zeros prior to taking the Fourier transform. This will remove noise and therefore increase sensitivity in the alignment and classification. However, it will also introduce correlations between the Fourier components that are not modelled. When set to No, then the solvent area is filled with random noise, which prevents introducing correlations.High-resolution refinements (e.g. ribosomes or other large complexes in 3D auto-refine) tend to work better when filling the solvent area with random noise (i.e. setting this option to No), refinements of smaller complexes and most classifications go better when using zeros (i.e. setting this option to Yes).*

Limit resolution E-step to (A): -1

*If set to a positive number, then the expectation step (i.e. the alignment) will be done only including the Fourier components up to this resolution (in Angstroms). This is useful to prevent overfitting, as the classification runs in RELION are not to be guaranteed to be 100% overfitting-free (unlike the 3D auto-refine with its gold-standard FSC). In particular for very difficult data sets, e.g. of very small or featureless particles, this has been shown to give much better class averages. In such cases, values in the range of 7-12 Angstroms have proven useful.*
