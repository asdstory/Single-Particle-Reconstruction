# Backgroud
### When you already get a at least 4.5A resolution after particle polishing and want to further improve/push, you may want to start estimate the beamtilt. Since Leginon uses Beamtilt when collecting images, e.g., 4x4 or 5x5 per batch, we may want to introduce the Beamtilt information from Leginon database into RELION star file so that we can estimate Beamtilt and do high order aberration correction. In another word, to do better CTF correction by doing high order aberration estimation/correction.

# Step 1 - Export the Beamtilt information from Leginon
